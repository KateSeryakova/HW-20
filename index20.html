    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      The Covid-19 pandemic forever changed the traditional, in-office work
      model. Remote and hybrid work has become the norm and is expected to
      become a permanent fixture in the modern workforce. We have observed that
      remote workers often feel lonely and isolated during their workday, which
      has a negative impact on their mental health. How might we improve remote
      work so that those who suffer from feelings of loneliness and isolation
      can find a way to create community and friendships?
    </p>

    <h3>The solution</h3>
    <p>
      We believe that creating a meet-up app for remote workers will help them
      feel less lonely during their workday and create opportunities to connect
      socially.
